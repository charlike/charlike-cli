## Install
Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```
$ npm install charlike-cli --global
```

or install using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

```
$ yarn global add charlike-cli
```

## Usage
> Just type `charlike --help` to see more. All of flags are optional
and are directly passed to the [charlike][] API.

```
  Usage
    $ charlike <name> <description> [flags]

  Common Flags
    --help            Show this output
    --version         Show version

  Flags
    --owner, -O       Project github owner - username or organization
    --name, -N        Name of the project, same as to pass first param
    --desc, -D        Project description, same as to pass second param
    --repo, -R        Repository pattern like username/projectName
    --engine, -E      Engine to be used, j140 by default
    --locals, -L      Context to pass to template files (support dot notation)
    --templates, -T   Path to templates folder
    --cwd, -C         Folder to be used as current working dir

  Examples
    $ charlike my-awesome-project 'some cool description'
    $ charlike minibase-data 'we are awesome' --owner node-minibase
    $ charlike -D 'abc description here' -N beta-trans -O gulpjs

  Issues: http://github.com/tunnckoCore/charlike
```

**Notes:**

- The `name` and `description` positional params are required if not flags instead are given
- The `engine` is that you want to use in the template files, but is also required to install some [jstransformer][] for it. For example if you want to use [handlebars][] in the templates, install [jstransformer-handlebars][]
- The `locals` support dot notation, so `--locals.foo.bar.baz 123` will set `foo.bar.baz` in your templates to have `123` value.
- If `owner` is not passed, it tries to use [git-user-name][] from current working directory

## Contributing
Pull requests and stars are always welcome. For bugs and feature requests, [please create an issue](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/charlike-cli/issues/new).  
Please read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for advice on opening issues, pull requests, and coding standards.  
If you need some help and can spent some cash, feel free to [contact me at CodeMentor.io](https://www.codementor.io/tunnckocore?utm_source=github&utm_medium=button&utm_term=tunnckocore&utm_campaign=github) too.

**In short:** If you want to contribute to that project, please follow these things

1. Please DO NOT edit [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [.verb.md](.verb.md) files. See ["Building docs"](#building-docs) section.
2. Ensure anything is okey by installing the dependencies and run the tests. See ["Running tests"](#running-tests) section.
3. Always use `npm run commit` to commit changes instead of `git commit`, because it is interactive and user-friendly. It uses [commitizen][] behind the scenes, which follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.
4. Do NOT bump the version in package.json. For that we use `npm run release`, which is [standard-version][] and follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.

Thanks a lot! :)

## Building docs
Documentation and that readme is generated using [verb-generate-readme][], which is a [verb][] generator, so you need to install both of them and then run `verb` command like that

```
$ npm install verbose/verb#dev verb-generate-readme --global && verb
```

_Please don't edit the README directly. Any changes to the readme must be made in [.verb.md](.verb.md)._

## Running tests
Clone repository and run the following in that cloned directory

```
$ npm install && npm test
```
